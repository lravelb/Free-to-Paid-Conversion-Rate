# Free-to-Paid-Conversion-Rate

For this project, I used MySQL.

Questions:
1. What is the free-to-paid conversion rate of students who have watched a lecture on the 365 platform?
2. What is the average duration between the registration date and when a student has watched a lecture for the first time (date of first-time engagement)?
3. What is the average duration between the date of first-time engagement and when a student purchases a subscription for the first time (date of first-time purchase)?
4. How can we interpret these results, and what are their implications?
